# EU4 Mods

# Sensible Development
The purpose of this mod is to revise how provinces develop in Europa Universalis IV.
It is designed to be standalone.
Development is an abstraction of the population and infastructure 
Development occasionally increases via events or missions, but is primarily increased by spending monarch power. This makes little sense conceptually, as governments cannot simply will people into being. It also encourages hyper-developed OPMs / small nations despite wealthy urban capitals traditionally being the product of large, stable states.
Moreover, depopulation is hardly a mechanic in-game. It is hard to decouple depopulation from a game that takes place over the Columbian Exchange, 30 Years' War, Deluge, and Manchu Conquest. Humanitarian disasters must be represented by appropriate mechanics for the game to feel remotely authentic.
